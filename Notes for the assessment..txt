The source of truth for questions - json parser from txt files with a common pattern for topics/question/prices/etc. Example directory: question_pack_name(or quiz_name)/round/topic/question1.txt. Then a simple script/function for parsing the data from the directory (or prompt the user for the path; prompt the user to choose the question pack with scanning for directories in the project's root).

1-D array to store the players: let players = [PLayer1.name, Player2.name, Player3.name];
1-D array to store the scores: let scores = [0, 0, 0];
2-D array to store the current topics as a grid: let currentTopics = [
[Topic1, Topic2, Topic3],
[Topic4, Topic5, Topic6]
];
Objects to store player data - mian Player object that player instances, eg. Player1 inherits from Player class,
class Player {
	constructor(name, score, ascii_logo*, colour, ...) {
		this.name = name;
		this.score = score;
		this.ascii_logo = ascii_logo;
		this.colour = colour;
		...
	}
	// Setters
	set name() {
		
	}
	set colour() {
	
	}
	...
	// Getters 
	get name() {
		return this.name;
	}
	get colour() {
		return this.colour;
	}
	...
	
};

const Player1 = new Player(name, score, colour, etc.);
...
